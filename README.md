# WatchMe
  
## Overview
Watch-me is a simple movie listing application.

This repository was a code challenge where I got the assignment to make this application use components, where before, it's code was all in the "App.tsx" file.

You can find the old application [here](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/ignite-template-componentizando-a-aplicacao).

## Installation & Running
First of all, install dependencies

```bash
yarn OR npm install
```

Then you need to run the fake api with:
```bash
yarn server OR npm run server
```

Finally, run the application with:
```bash
yarn dev OR npm run dev
```
